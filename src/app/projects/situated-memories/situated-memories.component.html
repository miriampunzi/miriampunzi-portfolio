                <h6>Memories situated in physical objects</h6>
                Users can save memories directly on the surface of physical objects.
                Memories: pictures, videos, audios, drawings, or writing annotations.
                Objects: whatever! From a little ring to the Eiffel Tower.

            <div class="col-6">
                <h6>Floating bubbles</h6>
                The memories are floating around the object like little bubbles.
                We use Augmented Reality technology.

                <h6>Save or retrieve your memories</h6>
                First, the user has to detect the object on which the memories are saved.
                Then, they can record a video, or take a photo, to save to the detected object, or they can tap on a bubble to open a past memory.

                <h6>Be nostalgic!</h6>
                Feel the nostalgia! Be emotional and take care of your special memories with your special object.
                We believe in this way memories will become more special.

            You receive as a present the ring engagement of your grand grand grand grand grand mother (this year is exchanged between generations) and you can see the marriage proposal of your grand grand grand grand grand mother associated with the ring.
            You find a ring on a street, and you decide to scan it with the app. You find out it was first created in ancient Egypt, then smuggled through the mediterranean sea, then stolen by nazis from a museum in France, then returned at the end of the 2nd World War and gifted as an engagement ring.You return it to the woman it belongs to that lives in a retiring room just near the street!

        <app-page-section sectionTitle="Challenges">
            <h6>What to do with different objects that look the same?
            </h6>
            Almost all the objects in the world are present in multiple copies.
            If all the memories are shown to all of these objects...
            <ul>
                <li>Feature! In shops, for example, people can see how to use the object.
                </li>
                <li>Problem! It can be annoying and it can affect negatively the attachment to the object.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Solutions:
            <ul>
                <li>Save and retrieve stories using a code, which has to be passed with the object.
                </li>
                <li>Put a marker on the object.
                </li>
                <li>Make objects react with the context. For example, according to their location or to who is holding it, it shows different memories and can highlight a particular stories.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>What to do when an objectâ€™s appearance changes as time goes by?
            </h6>
            Objects change over time (they become older or break).
            <ul>
                <li>People would be careful about their objects since they inherit the memories they input.
                </li>
                <li>The concept of memories saved in old objects could be lost.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Does the memory fade away as the object decays?
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the digital data in case the user wants to access it in another way. But then the design concept of memories situated in objects fells.
                </li>
                <li>Delete the digital data from the database.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Do we have to moderate the content? By whom?
            </h6>
            Crowdsourced moderation: some users analyze the content of stories and decide if they are appropriate.

            <h6>Who can see what memories? Privacy issues, data osnwership
            </h6>
            Users may want to keep the stories only for themselves or for a few intimates. 
            Solutions:
            <ul>
                <li>Code to access memories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Indicate the people to whom share the memory (like in social networks).
                </li>
            </ul>
